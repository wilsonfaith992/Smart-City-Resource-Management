# Smart City Resource Management

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform integrates IoT devices, data aggregation, resource optimization, and citizen feedback to create a transparent and efficient Smart City ecosystem. By leveraging smart contracts on a distributed ledger, we enable secure, automated, and democratic management of urban resources while promoting sustainability and improving quality of life.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. IoT Device Registration Contract

Manages the vast network of sensors and connected devices throughout the city.

**Key Features:**
- Secure device onboarding and authentication
- Cryptographic identity management for all IoT endpoints
- Automated maintenance scheduling and alerts
- Device health monitoring and status tracking
- Access control and permission management
- Privacy-preserving data collection settings
- Tamper-proof firmware version control

### 2. Data Aggregation Contract

Collects, processes, and analyzes data from various city systems to generate actionable insights.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data collection from multiple sources
- Data normalization and standardization
- Privacy-preserving aggregation methods
- Time-series analysis and pattern recognition
- Cross-domain data correlation
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Historical data archiving with integrity verification
- Open data API access with granular permissions

### 3. Resource Allocation Contract

Optimizes the distribution and utilization of city resources based on current needs and predictive analytics.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic resource distribution algorithms
- Predictive demand modeling
- Emergency resource prioritization
- Budget allocation transparency
- Automatic optimization triggers based on thresholds
- Resource utilization tracking and reporting
- Multi-objective optimization (cost, efficiency, sustainability)
- Integration with city procurement systems

### 4. Citizen Feedback Contract

Incorporates resident input directly into city management decisions, ensuring democratic participation in resource allocation.

**Key Features:**
- Secure citizen identity verification
- Community voting mechanisms for projects and initiatives
- Transparent feedback collection and processing
- Issue reporting with automated routing
- Participatory budgeting functionality
- Reputation systems for quality feedback
- Response tracking and accountability measures
- Multi-channel input support (mobile, web, kiosks)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Solidity compiler (v0.8+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- IPFS node (for distributed data storage)
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- IoT gateway software

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-city-resource-management.git
   cd smart-city-resource-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   npx truffle compile
   ```
   or
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to your chosen network:
   ```
   npx truffle migrate --network <network_name>
   ```
   or
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

5. Configure IoT gateways:
   ```
   node scripts/configure-gateways.js
   ```

## Usage Examples

### City Administrator
```javascript
// Register a new network of water quality sensors
await iotContract.registerDeviceBatch(
  "water-quality-network",
  sensorAddresses,
  {
    dataType: "water-metrics",
    updateFrequency: 3600, // seconds
    privacyLevel: 1, // public data
    maintenanceInterval: 7776000 // 90 days in seconds
  },
  {from: adminAddress}
);

// Adjust resource allocation for water management
await resourceContract.updateAllocation(
  "water-management",
  newBudget,
  priorityLevel,
  affectedDistricts,
  {from: adminAddress}
);
```

### IoT Device
```javascript
// Submit sensor reading
await dataContract.submitReading(
  deviceId,
  {
    metric: "water-quality-ph",
    value: 7.2,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    location: {lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060}
  },
  {from: deviceAddress}
);
```

### Citizen
```javascript
// Submit feedback on water quality in neighborhood
await feedbackContract.submitFeedback(
  "water-quality",
  {
    rating: 4,
    comment: "Water quality has improved but occasional odor issues persist",
    location: "Downtown District",
    suggestions: "Increase testing frequency during summer months"
  },
  {from: citizenAddress}
);

// Vote on proposed infrastructure project
await feedbackContract.voteOnProposal(
  projectId,
  true, // support
  {from: citizenAddress}
);
```

## Scalability and Performance
